# FINAL PROJECT README

## This project is completed by Zhaoyun Qin and Zengwenqi Lai.

## Introduction

Our project aims to find out an important factor that affects the price of housing. Therefore, we collected the data on shooting incidents as an indicator of violent crime and information on housing sales in New York to find out their relationship.

The goal is to determine the relationship between change in crime rate and change in housing prices in New York City. We hypothesize that a change in the crime rate has a lingering effect, and we would like to verify this hypothesis.
